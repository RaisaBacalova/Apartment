##Experience
1. It took me about 3 days to complete the project. The rest of the time I reviewed the material and watched other videos regarding the topic of this project. 
2. The main thing I liked about this project is that it was creative and I liked experimenting. 
3. I had a few challenges but the main one was the lights. I started baking them at the beginning before putting any objects to the scene and before even create all the lights. They just didn't work. 
I also couldn't get rid of pixelation. I tried everything in lighting section - compressed and uncompressed, different properties in quality section. Nothing seemed to change.
